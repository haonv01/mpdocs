- After enabling 2FA, admins need to use the **Authy app or Google Authenticator** on the phone to scan the QR code or enter the Key into the app to get the confirmation code.
- After QR code is saved in the app, it automatically generates confirmation code. Admin needs to get that code and enter the it to register
- After registering, from the next login, admins need to get the code from the app to verify so that they can access the dashboard
- The confirmation code created by the app after being replaced 30s still works for verification
- When **Force using 2FA** is enabled, the admin user cannot disable 2FA here



#### Check and remove Trusted Devices:
