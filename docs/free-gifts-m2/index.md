# Free Gifts
## Overview

Mageplaza Free Gift Extension allows shop owners to set free promotions and give free gifts when customers go shopping at their stores. In addition to setting up easy conditions for free gifts, admins can customize these rules with discounted products, customer groups, quantity restrictions, and so on. Thanks to this, customers are interested in shopping in your Magento store.

## How to use

- Customers can add Free Gift if the product is added to cart and applied the promotion. Free Gift will be added automatically or customers will select the gift they like depending on the installation of admins.
- When the product that is applied for promotion is removed from the cart, their free gifts are also removed.
