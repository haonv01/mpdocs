**Testing 3-D Secure Authentication**

You can use some following sample account to test 3D secure:
- **vendorName**: sandboxEC
- **integrationKey**: dq9w6WkkdD2y8k3t4olqu8H6a0vtt3IY7VEsGhAtacbCZ2b5Ud
- **integrationPassword**: hno3JTEwDHy7hJckU4WuxfeTrjD0N92pIaituQBw5Mtj7RG3V8zOdHCSPKwJ02wAV

To aid the implementation and testing of the 3-D Secure authentication functionality, each card will provide you with a specific 3-D Secure authentication result. This is indicated by the **status** value in the [3-D Secure](https://developer.sage.com/api/payments/api/#tag/3-D-Secure) object status column.

- To successfully authenticate the transaction, enter **password** into the password field during the 3-D Secure authentication process.
- You can enter **E:N:06** into the password field to simulate the scenario where an error occurred during authentication and you will receive the 3-D Secure **status: Error**
- You can enter **A:D:06** into the password field to simulate the scenario where the cardholder is not enrolled in scheme and you will receive the 3-D Secure **status: AttemptOnly**
- You can enter **U:N:06** into the password field to simulate the scenario where the 3D Secure authentication is not available and you will receive the 3-D Secure **status: Incomplete**

Admin needs to install **Surcharge** at **MySagePay** page to add extra fee for each card type. Visit **MySagePay** and go to `Settings > Surcharges`, click **Add** button to install **Surcharge** with each card.
