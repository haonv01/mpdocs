# Security 

## Overview 
Security issues for Magento have left a big question mark in the community of online stores. This problem is specially cared when Magento-based stores which own critical information and huge transactional volume can easily become ideal prey for blackhat hackers to attack. To help online stores prevent brutal break-ins, Mageplaza has developed the Security extension.

Magento 2 Security extension gives store owners the ability to detect the IP addresses that are intentionally attacking their store at any given time. Therefore, they have timely measures to prevent this issue such as blocking those IP addresses or sending warning emails to store owners.

#### 1.2. Blacklist/Whitelist IPs

![](https://i.imgur.com/CI5lmut.jpg)

* In the **Blacklist(s)** field:
  *  All IP addresses filled in this section will be blocked whenever accessing the admin login page.
  * You are able to block one IP address, multiple IP addresses, an IP address range or multiple IP address ranges.  IP addresses are separated with commas ``,``.
  * You can also block IP addresses as wildcard masks as below:
    * ``10.0.0. *``
    * ``10.0. *. *``
    * ``10.0.0. * - 123.0.0. *``
    * ``12.3. *. * - 222.0. *. *``
 * The mark ``*`` is in the `0 - 255` range.*
* In the **Whitelist(s)** field:
  * All IP addresses that are filled in this section will be allowed whenever accessing the admin login page.
  * You can allow one IP address, multiple IP addresses, an IP address range or multiple IP address ranges.  IP addresses are separated with commas ``,``.
  * You can also allow IP addresses as wildcard masks as these follows:
    * ``10.0.0. *``
    * ``10.0. *. *``
    * ``10.0.0. * - 123.0.0. *``
    * ``12.3. *. * - 222.0. *. *``
 * The mark ``*`` is in the `0 - 255` range.*

```
Blacklist(s) has higher priority than Whitelist(s) which means if a IP address is in the Blacklist, it will be blocked even it's in the Whitelist as well. So please make sure that you add your IP address in the Whitelist only. 
```

### II. Checklist
Checklist is a bunch of outlines pointing out which factor(s) can be the possible vulnarablity for your stores. Go to ``System > Security > Checklist``

![](https://i.imgur.com/YyRbNhE.png)

* In the **Check admin's username** box: Check the name of the admin account, if the default name is too obvious to guess or popular to name, the message will alert the store owner.
* In the **Check captcha** box
  * Check if captcha is enabled outside the frontend or in the backend.
  * Notify if store owner has enabled captcha. If not, message will warn store owner to enable captcha.
* In the **Check Magento Version** box: Check the version of Magento that the store owner is using. If this is not the latest version, the checklist will alert store owners to update to the latest version.
* In the **Check database prefix** box: 
  * Check if the store owner has used the database prefix or not. If not, the checklist will alert store owners to use them for database security.
  * If the store owner uses a database prefix, the checklist will notify them that their database is working properly.

```
For possible low-key factors that are not good for your security, they will be marked a red X. We'd highly recommend you should upgrade Security module to Professional edition to learn the detail way how to fix it throughoutly. 
```
  
### III. Login Log
From the admin panel, make your way to ``System > Security > Login Log``. All logins and login attempts will be recorded here.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gIBNONW.png)

Click ``View`` to see login details. Here’s an example:

![](https://i.imgur.com/8CbThoJ.png)

* Once an admin account has exceeded the allowed login attempts (which is configured at ``Store> Settings> Configuration> Advanced> Maximum Login Failures to Lockout Account``), there will be a mail notification to the store owner that this account has been lock up. Store owner should review this case again to reset safety settings. You can refer this [article](https://www.mageplaza.com/kb/how-to-reset-a-locked-admin-account-in-magento-2.html) to learn how to unlock an admin user account. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/EE2EZq9.png)

* Also, store owners can check the last login of a specific administratore. You can follow ``System > Permissions > All Users``

![](https://i.imgur.com/f7a0SkZ.png)

* The **Last login** column records the newest recent login attempt of an admin.
* The **IP Address** column records the IP address corresponding to the newest recent login attempt of an admin. Clicking on an IP address, it will redirect to the [Traceip](http://www.traceip.net/) page.


### Reset Command line

* If store admins mistakenly enter their IP addresses in the Blacklist, this following command lines can be run first: 
```
bin/magento security:reset blacklist 
```
Next, run this command line:
```
bin/magento cache:flush
```
*  After you have finished running those above command lines which reset the **Blacklist(s)** field, you will be able to access the admin page again. Note that the **Blacklist(s)** field is reset now so don’t forget to reenter the blacklist IPs.
* Similarly, the **Whitelist(s)** can be reset using these command lines: 
```
bin/magento security:reset whitelist
bin/magento cache:flush
```
* If you run the command ``bin/magento security:reset``, both **Blacklist(s)** and **Whitelist(s)** will be reset.
