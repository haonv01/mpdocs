* **Form Post Paths**
    * Enter the path (url) where will process your form information 
      
     For example: newsletter/subscriber/new/, display reCAPTCHA in the email address field on the website.

Below are some detailed steps:

- Step 1: Login to your website
- Step 2: Choose Form that you want to display reCAPTCHA and open the Test window
- Step 3: After that, choose **Element** tab, then choose the form that contains the field you want to add reCAPTCHA

![](https://i.imgur.com/SLQ7BZp.png)

- Step 4: In the Subscriber Form in the **Action** field, copy the URL path. (In this example, the URL is **"newsletter/subscriber/new/"**)
- Step 5: Paste the URL into the **Form Post Paths** field

    * The paths are separated by down stream.
    * If you this field is empty and you fill in the information in the **CSS Selectors** field, reCAPTCHA still displays on the form that you fill in the information CSS Selectors, but it doesn't still work on that form.

* **CSS Selectors**
    * You need to take CSS Selector of the form. At our example, we will take ID of the form.
    
    For example: #newsletter-validate-detail, display reCAPTCHA in the **Subscriber**
    
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/91U0SoK.png)
    
    * The IDs are separated by down stream.
    * If you leave this field blank while filling in the information in **Form Post Paths** field, reCAPTCHA won't display on the form you want.
    
`Note`:

* In the **Custom Form Position** field, if you want to show reCAPTCHA on the form you want, you have to fill in all information of 2 fields: **Form Post Paths and CSS Selectors**.
* Using the invisible CAPTCHA system outside the frontend, most users won't see CAPTCHAs at all, not even the "I'm not a robot" checkbox. If you are flagged as "suspicious" by the system, then it will display the usual challenges. Hence, If you want to check it you can try to click the Create an Account button many times.
* ``Need to download the library of Google Recaptcha so that when you run this extension, there's no error occur``
* When you cannot access to the admin panel while reCAPTCHA enables, you can use the following command to disable the module via composer as well as can access the admin page as usual.
